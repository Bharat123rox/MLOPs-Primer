# MLOPs Primer

**Machine learning operations (MLOps)** is becoming an exciting space as we figure out the best practices and technologies to deploy machine learning models in the real world. MLOps enable ML teams to build responsible and scalable machine learning systems and infrastructure. This facilitates tasks that range from risk assessment to building and testing to monitoring.

While still in its infancy, MLOps has attracted machine learning engineers and software engineers in general.

With every new paradigm comes new challenges and opportunities to learn. In this post, I highlight a few of the resources I am using to upskill and inform myself on the latest in the world of MLOps. I have listed a few educational resources as a start but I plan to build this out as a more comprehensive primer for the future. The primer will include emerging tools for MLOps, research, use cases, and best practices focusing on technical details while still making it accessible to every ML researcher and practitioner regardless of the level of experience.

## Introduction
**Introducing MLOps** - One of the best places to get a high-level introduction of the MLOps space is in the book “Introducing MLOps” by Mark Treveil and the Dataiku team.
